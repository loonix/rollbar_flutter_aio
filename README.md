# rollbar-flutter-aio

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) notifier for reporting exceptions, errors and log messages to [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com).

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:rollbar_flutter_aio/rollbar.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  const config = Config(
    accessToken: 'YOUR-ROLLBAR-ACCESSTOKEN',
    package: 'rollbar_flutter_example',
  );

  await RollbarFlutter.run(config, () => runApp(const MyApp()));
}
```

With this setup, `rollbar-flutter` will automatically catch and report any unhandled errors in your application.

You can also explicitly report errors or messages to Rollbar:

```dart
await Rollbar.info('Nothing out of the ordinary so far...');
```

See the [`example` directory](./example/) for a complete example.
